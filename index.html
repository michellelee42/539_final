		<p>Hi there! We’re just a group of people who enjoy climbing. 
		<p>Our club was first made in January, 2015 by a few Korean graduate students from the University of Michigan. 
			<br>Since then, it’s gradually expanded into a larger crew that now consists of undergrads, graduate students, and alumni who work in the area.</p>
	
		<p>Currently, we climb at a local gym called Planet Rock at the following days/times:
			<br>-Tuesday 7pm-10pm
			<br>-Thursday 7pm-10pm
			<br>-Saturday 3pm-6pm</p>
	
		<p>We also like to go outdoor climbing whenever we can, so check out the “Memories” page to see where we’ve been around the country so far!</p>
	
		<p>We always love to meet new people so don’t hesitate in contacting us if you’re interested in joining us for climbing or if you have any questions. Thank you.</p>
