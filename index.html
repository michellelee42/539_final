	<p>Hi there - welcome! We’re just a group of people who enjoy climbing.
		<p>The Michigan Rock Climbing (Mirocle) club was first made in January, 2015 by a few Korean graduate students from
			the University of Michigan.
			<br>Since then, it’s gradually expanded into a larger crew that now consists of a variety of people including
			undergrads, graduate students, and
			alumni who work in the area.</p>

		<p>Currently, we climb together as a group at a local indoor gym called Planet Rock at the following days/times:
			<br>-Tuesday 7pm-10pm
			<br>-Thursday 7pm-10pm
			<br>-Saturday 3pm-6pm</p>

		<p>We also like to go outdoor climbing whenever we can, so check out the “Memories” page to see where we’ve been
			around the country so far!</p>

		<p>We always love to meet new people so don’t hesitate in contacting us if you’re interested in joining us for
			climbing. Thanks :) </p>
