    <h1>Different Types of Climbing</h1>
    <p>There are several types of climbing provided for us at the gym.</p>
    <h2>Bouldering</h2>
    <p>This is the simplest form of climbing as it requires no equipment such as a harness or rope. The climbing problems are built on walls that go not too far up from the ground, and the “ground” is a
        cushiony mat that protects us in case we fall. Depending on the problem, one may require more strength while others use more balance skills.</p>

    <h2>Top-Rope Climbing</h2>
    <p>Unlike bouldering that one can do on their own, top-rope climbing requires a partner – one person climbs the
        wall, and the other person stays on the ground, who is called a belayer.
        <br>The belayer has extreme responsibilities as it is their job to manage the rope to catch the climber in
        case of a fall.
        <br>Top-roping requires harnesses for both people and a rope that’s secured to an overhead anchor.</p>

    <h2>Lead Climbing</h2>
    <p>Lead climbing is for people who are skilled top-rope climbers since the climber clips a rope into a series
        of quickdraws that are aligned with the route as they climb up the wall.
        <br>This is also partner-based, and the climber is prone to taking harder falls than when top-roping.</p>
