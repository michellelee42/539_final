        <div class="panel">
            <h2>A Workout for the Body and Mind</h2>
            <p>Bouldering is rock climbing stripped down to its raw essentials. Leaving behind ropes and harnesses and
                just
                using climbing shoes and a bag of chalk over safety mats, your challenge is to climb short but tricky
                bouldering "problems" (a route, or sequence of moves) using balance, technique, strength, and your
                brain.
                You don't need experience or lots of expensive kit to have a go - making it really easy to get into if
                you've never tried it before.</p>
            <p>The climbs are high enough to be exciting, but not so high that they're hugely intimidating. Using
                safety
                mats means that the risks of falling off can be managed, and leaving the ropes behind means that you
                are
                free to concentrate on the climbing, not the equipment. It's just you, the wall, and your friends on
                the
                ground egging you on.</p>
            <p>Every climb, or "problem", has its own solution, and to successfully climb it you need to work it out.
                Depending on your body shape and personal strengths, your solution could be different to the next
                person's.
                If you're tall, you might be able to reach the next hold more easily on spaced-out problems - but find
                yourself cramped when the route takes you into the nooks and crannies of the wall. It all evens out in
                the
                end.</p>
            <p>The key to the problem could be about how you position your body when you climb, or what order you put
                your
                feet and hands on the wall - or there might be a sneaky "toe hook" or one of countless other climbing
                techniques that suddenly takes the problem from impossible, to crushed. You might need to refine your
                technique before you can do it - or train some more and get stronger!</p>
            <p>Bouldering is a great physical workout, using muscles all over your body - not just your arms. Core
                strength
                is a real focus, as is flexibility. But unlike some other forms of exercise, it's so much fun you might
                not
                notice that you've had a big workout - until you wake up the next day! If you want to see what regular
                climbing could do for your physique, just take a look at some pictures of famous rock climbers online -
                it's pretty impressive.</p>
            <p>It also takes a bit of thinking, as often brute force alone won't be enough to get you to the top.
                You'll
                need to think about how to solve the various bouldering problems, try some different techniques and
                methods
                out, and hopefully eventually crack it. This makes a bouldering session totally absorbing, making your
                forget about your stresses and leaving your mind clear and refreshed at the end of it all. If you're
                new to
                the sport, you'll find that you make big improvements in your climbing ability after only a
                few sessions, as you use and tone those rarely used muscles. Breaking into the harder grades takes a
                bit
                longer, but by that stage you'll be hooked!</p>

        <button class="accordion">Top-Rope Climbing</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h2>Perfect for Beginner Climbers</h2>
            <p>Top rope climbing is all about having fun, being outside, and climbing rock faces. Toproping offers the
                rock
                climbing experience with all the rewards but minimal risks. Toproping, simply put, is climbing a rock
                face
                with the climbing rope always anchored above you. If you fall, you usually only fall a few feet until
                the
                rope catches you, minimizing the risk of injury.</p>
            <p>Toproping at an indoor climbing gym or outside on real rock is the first introduction to rock climbing
                for
                most people. Toproping is a great way to learn the basics of climbing movement, how to set up an anchor
                on
                the cliff-top, how to belay a climber and then lower her down, and how to have fun climbing. Toproping
                is
                ideal for beginners since they can concentrate on climbing movements and techniques rather than worry
                about
                the dire effects of gravity and falling. Advanced climbers often top rope hard routes to work on new
                techniques or just to do laps to build strength and endurance. You can toprope climb just about
                anywhere
                and you don’t need lots of equipment.</p>
            <h2>4 Essential Toprope Skills</h2>
            <p>Below are the essential climbing skills that you need to learn to safely top rope climb outside. Always
                remember that climbing is dangerous and you are responsible for your own safety. Setting up secure and
                safe
                toprope anchors requires a working knowledge of climbing safety techniques and skills. If you are
                learning
                to climb, it is best to learn these skills under the watchful of a more experienced climber or take a
                class
                from a guide or climbing school that specifically teaches you to set up equalized anchors.</p>
            <p>--You need the ability to set up a safe anchoring system at the top of the route for the rope and
                climber</p>
            <p>--Belaying and Lowering:
                You need to know how to create a belay anchor and safely belay a climber as she ascends. When she
                reaches
                the top, you need to know how to lower her back to the ground</p>
            <p>--Rope Management:
                You need to know how to tie into the rope with a Figure-8 Follow-Through knot, then how to handle the
                rope
                while belaying and lowering</p>
            <p>--Safety:
                You need to create a safe climbing environment by managing and mitigating the dangers of climbing by
                wearing a helmet at the base of a cliff and when climbing, using redundant anchors, making sure the
                belayer
                on the ground is anchored to a tree or piece of gear, and paying attention to the climber and belayer</p>

        <button class="accordion">Lead Climbing</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h2>Lead Climbing Basics</h2>
            <p>Lead climbing is exhilarating and challenging. It allows you to chart a new course up the cliff face and
                push yourself physically and mentally in ways that you can’t when top roping. With lead climbing, the
                rope
                runs directly from the belayer to the climber. As the climber goes up the cliff, he or she clips the
                rope
                into bolts that are fixed to the wall or removable pieces of trad gear. This differs from top-rope
                climbing
                where the rope initially runs up the wall to a top anchor and back down to the climber.</p>
            <p>On the “sharp end of the rope,” the lead climber must move above a bolt or piece of protection in order
                to
                advance up the route. If he or she falls before clipping the rope into the next bolt or piece, then the
                fall will be at least twice as long as the distance above the last piece: A climber three feet above
                the
                last piece, for example, would fall six feet, plus a little farther due to rope stretch.</p>
            <h3>Step 1: Get Properly Trained</h3>
            <p>Take courses or learn from a reputable guide company or a trustworthy friend. Before leading, you need
                to be
                solid in placing trad gear (if you plan to lead a trad climb), clipping quickdraws, belaying a leader,
                managing the rope and building anchors.</p>
            <h3>Step 2: Assess Your Mental Readiness</h3>
            <p>Before attempting to lead, ask yourself if you’re mentally ready for it. Be wary of climbing buddies who
                say, “just go for it” or “you got this” without honestly considering your experience and technical
                skills.
                Lead climbing requires you to clip gear, manage the rope and keep a cool head while climbing above
                gear,
                all things that you don’t have to do while top roping.</p>
            <p>Lead climbing can be scary and there’s no shame in admitting that. If your head is not ready for it,
                continue to work on your skills and use every opportunity to follow a lead climber as a learning
                experience. You can observe gear placements, practice technique and move steadily closer to being ready
                to
                give it a try.</p>
            <h3>Step 3: Do a Mock Lead</h3>
            <p>A good option for first-time lead climbers is to do a mock lead. With a mock lead, you climb a route on
                top
                rope while also leading up with another rope. This allows you to focus on placing gear, clipping bolts
                and
                managing the rope on lead with the security of having a top rope as backup to catch you if you fall. To
                do
                a mock lead, you need two climbing ropes and two belayers.</p>
            <h3>Step 4: Start Easy</h3>
            <p>When you are ready to try your first lead, keep the following in mind:</p>
            <p>--Don’t be ashamed to get on a route that’s frequented by totally new climbers.<br><br>
                --Just because you can climb 5.10 on top rope does not mean you can lead climb at that level.<br><br>
                --Learning to lead in a climbing gym can be a good place to start, but know that when you go outdoors
                you’ll
                need to be able to build and clean an anchor, which are two things you don’t need to do at the gym.<br><br>
                --Start on a route where you feel completely stable and under control so that you can focus on properly
                placing gear, clipping bolts and managing the rope.</p>
